Usage Warnings
==========================================
.. warning::  Improper setup and usage can cause damage to system components.

- Read the following warnings before starting to work with your system. These are crucial 
  aspects to consider during setup and usage that are included in the documentation but 
  are listed here for your convenience.
- Read the complete documentation carefully to understand how the system works and refer 
  back to these warnings before using it. 

Hardware
--------------------------------
- Connecting or disconnecting the breakout board while the PC is on causes damage to the 
  FMChost. For more details, see :ref:`breakout_setup`.
   
.. warning::
   **Power off the PC before connecting/disconnecting the breakout board.**

- Headstage voltage must be configured correctly for operation. The voltage that works 
  for one headstage can damage another, and depends on your hardware configuration such 
  as tether length. For more details, see :ref:`tether_voltage`.

.. warning::
   **Ensure each headstage is configured with the correct voltage according to its 
   specification before connecting and switching on the headstage port switch.** 


Software
--------------------------------
*For the current Bonsai.ONIX library which is being revised to improve usability*

- Headstage port voltage configuration is managed via the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node 
  or the :ref:`bonsai_headstageportcontroldev` node. The changes you make using these 
  nodes apply immediately and persist in hardware even if the Bonsai workflow is not 
  running. Headstage port voltage is reset to the default 4.9V only on a power cycle 
  (power off and on â€” not reboot).

.. warning::
   **Keep the headstage port switches off until you have configured each port correctly.**
   
.. warning::
   **Remember to set the headstage voltage to the desired value after a power cycle.**
 
- The :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` provides a dynamic window to read and write to hardware,
  but parameters such as device voltage are not saved in the node when the workflow is 
  saved. The :ref:`bonsai_headstageportcontroldev` node also reads and writes to hardware, 
  but parameters are saved with the workflow. On loading a workflow, Bonsai writes the 
  parameter values set when the workflow was last saved.

.. warning::
   When you configure the voltage, the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node shows that value 
   and when you save the workflow this value is not saved. Therefore, that value will 
   not be set to hardware when you load the workflow again. On loading the workflow, 
   the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node will be reading the voltage that is already set 
   on the hardware and showing this  in the ``LinkVoltage`` field.

.. warning::
   When you configure the voltage, the :ref:`bonsai_headstageportcontroldev` node shows 
   that value and when you save the workflow this value is saved. Therefore, that value 
   will be set to hardware when you load the workflow again. If you make changes to the 
   voltage value (with any node) and save the workflow, they will be saved in the 
   ``LinkVoltage`` property of the :ref:`bonsai_headstageportcontroldev` node.
 
- Any workflows containing the :ref:`bonsai_NeuropixelsV1edev` node require the 
  :ref:`headstage_neuropix1e` to be connected before the workflows can be opened or 
  loaded into Bonsai.
   
.. warning::
   Check that the voltage set to the headstage port is correct for the 
   :ref:`headstage_neuropix1e` by using a workflow of a single :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` 
   node to configure it before connecting the headstage in order to open a workflow that 
   contains the :ref:`bonsai_NeuropixelsV1edev` node.

- An :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node or any device node in a workflow can override device 
  settings in another workflow if device addresses are not distinct, because these nodes 
  read/write directly to hardware.

.. warning::
   **Only have one workflow open at a time.**
