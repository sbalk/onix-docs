``liboni`` is a C library that implements the `ONI API Specification
<https://github.com/open-ephys/ONI>`_. It is written in C to facilitate cross
platform and cross-language use. It is composed of the following files:

#. :ref:`onidefs.h`: common definitions
#. :ref:`oni.h`: core API
#. :ref:`onidriver.h`: device driver translation layer that must be
   implemented for a particular host hardware connection and
   firmware.
#. onidriverloader.h: private functions used for dynamically loading the
   hardware driver. This is used internally by the :ref:`oni.h` and can be
   ignored during both software and driver development.
#. :ref:`onix.h`: ONIX-specific, out of ONI API specification
   scope, definitions and functions. Can be ignored for projects that
   do not interact with ONIX hardware.

``liboni`` is a low level library intended for use by high-level language
binding and/or software plugin developers. The only external dependency aside
from the C standard library and dynamic library loading functions is is a
device driver translation layer (:ref:`onidriver.h`, "driver" for short) that
fulfills the requirements of the ONI Host Interconnect Specification. Our API
implementation contains drivers for

#. `RIFFA <https://github.com/KastnerRG/riffa>`_ is a free and open-source
   FPGA IP core and device driver that allows the ONI communication channels to
   be implemented using the PCIe bus. **ONIX PCIe-based hardware uses RIFFA.**
#. `Xillybus <http://xillybus.com/>`_ is a proprietary FPGA IP cores and free
   and open source device drivers to allow the communication channels to be
   implemented using the PCIe bus. The licensing terms for the FPGA core are
   extremely unclear, although "trial" use is allowed. Use at your own risk.

From the API's perspective, hardware communication abstracted to IO system
calls (``open``, ``read``, ``write``, etc.) on file descriptors. File
descriptor semantics and behavior are identical to either normal files
(configuration channel) or named pipes (signal, data input, and data output
channels).  Importantly, the low-level synchronization, resource allocation,
and logic required to use the hardware communication backend is implicit to
``liboni`` API function calls. Orchestration of the communication backend is
not directly managed by the library user.
