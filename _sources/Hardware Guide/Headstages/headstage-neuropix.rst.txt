Neuropixels-1.0 Headstage
##############################
The ONIX **Neuropixels-1.0 Headstage** is a serialized, multifunction headstage
targeting `Neuropixels 1.0 probes <https://www.neuropixels.org/probe>`__.

    :alt: ONIX Headstage-Neuropixels-1.0 v1.2.

- Two Neuropixels 1.0 probes
- A BNO055 9-axis IMU for real-time, 3D orientation tracking
- Three TS4231 light to digital converters for real-time, 3D position tracking
  with HTC Vive base stations
- An Intel MAX10 FPGA for real-time probe data correction (offset removal and
  gain correction) and data arbitration

Coaxial Link
***********************************
For details on data serialiation and headstage gateware, have a look at the
:ref:`serialization` page, which describes how coax headstages operatate in
general terms. The Neuropixels-1.0 Headstage has the following coaxial link
properties:

.. important:: \*The headstage includes an undervoltage and overvoltage lockout
    circuit that will only allow it to turn on when the proper link voltage is
    present headstage. If the headstage is not turning on, make sure that the
    voltage at the headstage itself is within the valid range
