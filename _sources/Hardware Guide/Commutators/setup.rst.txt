Setup
#########################

The active commutator should be placed above the behavioral setup, such that
the animal can travel the full length of the arena. Bonsai communicates with
the commutator through a USB cable, which also powers the device.

1. Mount the active commutator above the setup (you can use the same frame as
   the base stations, with the commutator in the middle).

2. Connect the commutator to the computer using a USB to micro-USB cable

3. If the commutator makes too much noise while turning, apply plastic-safe
   grease (e.g. XX) to the 3D-printed gears to reduce noise.
